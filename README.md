# P1.Test.github.io
A Web Developing test with HTML, CSS, and possibly JS.

Welcome! This is just a test code, not something important, if you have any comments please let me know, as I'm new to these 3 languages.

My goal is to build a simple website that moves to other websites when you click certain parts in it.

If you can help in anyway, please let me know, I would appreciate it.

Thanks.
